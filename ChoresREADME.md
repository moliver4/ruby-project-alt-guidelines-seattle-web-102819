Chores Organizer Mod 1 Final Project 
************************************

Thank You for your interest in my Chores Organizer Project!

This is a command line application that allows the User/Parent to manage and keep track of their chores for their children.
The User/Parent can do any of the following:
- View all chores
    All, Incomplete, or Complete
    By Child or Per Child
- Create a new chore by assigning a task to a child.
    -A Chore will not be created if it already exists for that child.
    -A Chore will not be created if a child's skill level is LESS than the task's difficulty.
- Update a chore to complete once it is done.
- Calculate the amount of money/reward the child has earned via completed chores.
- Add/Delete Children (Name, Age, Skill level)
- Add/Delete Tasks (Title, Difficulty, Reward)

============================================
After downloading the program and prior to running, please run bundle install in the directory to install necessary gems.
